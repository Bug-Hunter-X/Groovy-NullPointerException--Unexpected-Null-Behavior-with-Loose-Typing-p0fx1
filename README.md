# Groovy NullPointerException: Unexpected Null Behavior with Loose Typing

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Groovy related to unexpected null behavior due to its dynamic typing.  The `myMethod` function showcases how null values during addition, list concatenation, or string concatenation can lead to unexpected `null` return values instead of exceptions.  This can make debugging more challenging and lead to subtle errors.

The `bug.groovy` file contains the code exhibiting the problem, while `bugSolution.groovy` offers improved handling of null values.

## Problem

Groovy's loose typing allows for various data types to be passed into a method without explicit type declarations.  However, when null values are involved in operations like +, the result is always null. This behavior can be unexpected, especially when working with lists or strings.

## Solution

The solution involves adding explicit null checks before attempting any operation using null values. The `bugSolution.groovy` file showcases how to robustly handle these situations, providing safer and more predictable results.
